As you complete each lab, you should provide a description of your features and changes here.

## VR Lab: Farmstead

Lab 0: Added all SDKs and pushed to Github Repository (9.11.19)

Lab 1: Intend to make an interaction to make the player pick 10 apples off apple trees (9.18.19)

Lab 1 (update): Added bucket, script, and everything needed for collecting apples into bucket. Once all 5 are collected message pops up on canvas next to tree letting the player know they're done. (9.25.19)

Attendance 9.25.19: Rumpletiltskin

Lab 2: An app that allows a AR look into different surgical procedure items (like pace makers and such) to allow patients that are going to undergo such procedures a better way to understand what's going on. Would allow the user to break the item apart and see the different parts and what they do / how it works. This could also be used for things aside from surgical items for inventors / manufactorers to better show off their creations to customers.
