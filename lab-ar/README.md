As you complete each lab, you should provide a description of your features and changes here.

## AR Lab:

Lab 2: An app that allows a AR look into different surgical procedure items (like pace makers and such) to allow patients that are going to undergo such procedures a better way to understand what's going on. Would allow the user to break the item apart and see the different parts and what they do / how it works. This could also be used for things aside from surgical items for inventors / manufactorers to better show off their creations to customers.
